Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  - The way I try to write my programs is that they are in the most simple manner I can with good descriptions so other developers can understand my work and not need to decipher what my code is producing. Creating my CRUD Python module in project one which was seperate program from my dashboard made it easier to adjust my code without feeling overwhelmed with content. I could use my CRUD module in the future for my own projects to freshen up my skills throughout my journey and hopefully one day incorperate those skills into my career.
    
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  - The way I approach any problem is to look over all the material first and figure out what is being asked of me, make sure to write things down that I need to accomplish and throughout the project try and debug as often as possible to avoid being overwhelmed with errors.
    
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  - Computer scientists help customers see their dreams come to life, they know their way to producing the code that can make what the client has envisioned become a reality. This type of work matters because it is the future and my work with this project has given me the basics to producing more advance databases in the future if I choose to persue this in my career.
